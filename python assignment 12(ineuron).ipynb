    "PdfFileReader() needs to be opened in read-binary mode by passing 'rb' as the second argument to open(). Likewise, the File object passed to PyPDF2. PdfFileWriter() needs to be opened in write-binary mode with 'wb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a Page object by calling the getPage() method on a PdfFileReader object and passing it the page number of the page you're interested in.\n",

    "\n",

    "#4 If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish, what must you do before you can obtain Page objects from it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will open the encrypted file with the correct password and create a copy of it by iterating through every page of it and adding it to our new PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5 What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n",
    "\n",

    "#7 How do you obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object that’s stored in a variable named doc?\n",
    "\n",
    "we open a .docx file in Python, call docx.Document(), and pass the filename demo.docx. This will return a Document object, which has a paragraphs attribute that is a list of Paragraph objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use doc.paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8 What type of object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables?\n",

    "A Run object has these variables (not a paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "#9 What is the difference between False, True, and None for the bold variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "True always makes the Run object bolded and False makes it always not bolded, no matter what the style's bold setting is. None will make the Run object just use the style's bold setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10 How do you create a Document object for a new Word document?\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the docx.Document() function.\n",
